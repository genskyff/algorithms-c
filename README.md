# Algorithms implemented in C

## Overview
This is a repository implemented in C for various basic algorithms and data structures, intended for learning and recording. It is licensed under the GPLv3 and designed to be modular, making it easy to be imported into other code.

## Features
- Uses only the C standard library, with no third-party libraries
- Unit tests for almost every function
- Strict adherence to the C17 standard, tested and passed on MSVC, GCC, and Clang
